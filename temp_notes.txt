const admin = require('firebase-admin');
const serviceAccount = require('./service-account.json'); // User needs to provide this or we use a different method if not available.
// Actually, I can't easily run admin SDK without service account. 
// I will use client SDK in a temporary script executed via node IF I can auth, but I can't easily auth in node without secrets.

// Alternative: I will modify `src/components/views/admin-view.tsx` temporarily to log the total count of products fetched when "All" tab is active.
// Oh wait, I can just increase the limit in Admin View to 100 to see if they appear. 
// AND I will check if the "Seed" function worked.

// Let's first try to increase the pagination limit in `admin-view.tsx` to 100 which is a safe quick fix to see if it's just a UI limit.
