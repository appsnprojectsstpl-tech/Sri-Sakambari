// Check firestore rules or just write a small test script to simulate order
const firebase = require('firebase/app');
require('firebase/firestore');

// Since I can't run browser code effectively here to test rules,
// I will rely on code review of 'firestore.rules' if available.
// I'll search for firestore.rules file.
